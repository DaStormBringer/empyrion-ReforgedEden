They possessed some of the thickest armor and would drop from orbit onto populated areas, extend tendrils into the ground and emit infective spores into the atmosphere for maximum contamination.\nAfter depleting an area, they would evolve into one of several configurations and either root themselves permanently in place or rise again as something new.\n\n[b][c][fb00ff]Decimator[-][/c][/b]\nClassification: Frigate\nThe Decimators are the evolved forms of the Infectors after they've absorbed the required materials from the environment after a successful drop from orbit.

Possessing impossibly thick armor and no armaments on it's upper side it was armored from above from all forms of attack, while the disruptors on it's underside would clear a massive swathe beneath the entity as it produced and dropped troop-type entities onto the ground below.\n\n[b][c][fb00ff]Eradicator[-][/c][/b]\nClassification: Destroyer\nAlthough few in number, the Eradicators were vessel-type legacy that evolved for the sole purpose of destruction. They possessed none of the infectious capabilities of the other vessel-type entities, focused solely on evolving it's offensive capabilities. Dozens of banks of disruptors with no blind spots and acceleration beyond what any vessel that size should be able to handle.\nTo date, only one Eradicator has ever been destroyed and only because it had been forced into the gravity well of a Gas Giant after being rammed by a Tovera-Class Dreadnought. The impact destroyed the Dreadnought.\n\n[b][c][fb00ff]Cataclysm[-][/c][/b]\nClassification: Unknown\nOnly one Cataclysm has ever been recorded. A Ghy'st squadron encountered it during deep reconnaissance into Legacy-controlled space as it was observed destroying a fully corrupted planet. Scattering the infected fragments of the planet in the direction of inhabited systems.\nObservations of it's effect on the surrounding area indicates that it generates it's own gravity with mass, suggesting that the mass of the entity is several thousand times higher than its dimensions suggest.\nAfter rendering the Legacy dormant and ending the War of Silence, no Cataclysm was ever found.\n\n[c][fb00ff][b]Reaver[/b][-][/c]\nClassification: Creature\nNot a vessel-type legacy, but the final evolution of an infected individual that's highly compatible with the Legacy virus after a prolonged and successful maturation with a supply of raw materials, both organic and inorganic.\nSoldier-Type Legacy numbered at only a few dozen, but each one developed their own advanced weapons within their bodies, produced forcefields and moved with lightning-fast speed on the ground and through the manipulation of gravity fields was capable of flight on par with spacecrafts, including the ability to initialize short-ranged warp jumps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is still not known whether the ship came down from the moon in [c][8ab3ff]The Downfall[-][/c] or if it was buried in the ice all this time.\n\nThe spacecraft was taken to the nearest and best-equipped facility in [c][8ab3ff]New Zealand[-][/c] that was able to properly perform the examination and replication of the alien technology where it underwent extensive testing and experimentation at the hands of the world's best specialists.\nProgress was slow, as many of the materials the spacecraft (named ""[c][8ab3ff]Phoenix-1[-][/c]"") was made from could not be found or replicated and the computer systems that operated the ship were heavily degraded. Even still, the technological advancements in a multitude of scientific fields was significant and by 2461 the first UCH-built spacecraft capable of extrasolar warp was built: The [c][8ab3ff]UCH-001 Hyperion[-][/c].\n\nAfter dozens of successful warp tests over the course of four years, the Hyperion was determined to be a success and full-scale production of a Fleet was ordered. [c][8ab3ff]Operation Phoenix[-][/c] was confirmed.\n[b]There were two goals to this UCH Fleet:[/b]\nThe first was to find more of the materials retrieved from the Phoenix-1 and establish a supply line back to Earth. Using the technological advances of the alien technology to reverse the damage dealt to the planet from The Downfall using new materials in terraforming applications.\nThe second, if the first failed, was to find and colonize a habitable planet and begin the transfer of the human population to the new planet.\n\nIt wasn't surprising that the alien spacecraft recovered from Antarctica was equipped with weapons, they were theorized to be used for destroying meteorites and preventing collisions. Until the final flight of the Hyperion in [c][8ab3ff]2472[-][/c], where a long-ranged warp jump past Jupiter where the fleet was being assembled at [c][8ab3ff]Apollon Station[-][/c] ended with the disappearance of the Hyperion.\nThere were no problems with the Hyperion's warp drive and no observable issues with its insertion into [c][8ab3ff]Hyperspace[-][/c]. Suddenly the prospect of jumping a fleet of unarmed transports to [c][8ab3ff]Proxima Centauri[-][/c], the nearest habitable system to our own, took on a darker tone and calls for weapons to be added to the fleet were made, as a precaution.\n\nOn [c][8ab3ff]25 July 2473[-][/c] the UCH Fleet departed the fleet construction yards at Apollon Station in Jupiter's outer orbit and prepared a warp jump utilizing the [c][8ab3ff]UCH-002 M.S Titan[-][/c]'s Warp Field Generator to create a warp field large enough to move the entire fleet to Proxima Centauri.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pda_CKKWES4,"[b][c][ffffff]Shields:[-][/c][/b]\nShields are defensive countermeasures employed by a variety of vessels and structures designed to deflect or absorb the impacts of conventional kinetic weaponry and explosives; reducing their damage to a structure by consuming power and a catalyst (Pentaxid).\nWhile shields will protect from any weapon, they are highly resilient to [c][ffffff]kinetic weapons[-][/c] such as [c][ff5c5c]Miniguns, Cannons, Flak Shells, Rockets, Missiles, Railgun Slugs[-][/c] and [c][ff5c5c]Artillery Shells[-][/c].\nConversely, shields are highly susceptible to damage from [c][ffffff]Energy-based weapons[-][/c] such as [c][6bd600]Lasers, Plasma, Positron Beams, Electromagnetic Pulse Weapons, Antimatter Torpedoes[-][/c] and[c][6bd600] Ion Cannons[-][/c] that will quickly deplete shields under sustained fire.\n\nThe majority of Zirax weaponry consists of energy weapons. However, in order to operate in any atmosphere, their weapons possess lower accuracy, speed and lose a great deal of energy in thermal output. This makes their lasers easier to dodge for faster crafts and deal less shield damage than the weapons of Polaris, Kriel or the UCH but more versatile.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Shield Boosters:[-][/c][/b]\nA recent advancement in shielding technology has lead to the development of shield modulation technology. In the past, shields were a fixed thing. You would use a shield and it would provide total protection.\nWith the advent of the Shield Booster technology, it's possible to improve the strength or charging speed of your shields. They do come at a cost however as the devices draw power while the shield is charging and are quite heavy.\n[b][c][00ff00]Shield Capacitor:[-][/c][/b] Increases the strength of your shields, but reduces the speed at which they recharge slightly.\n[b][c][ffbb00]Shield Charger:[-][/c][/b] Increases the recharge speed of your shields, but reduces their strength slightly.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Contact Surfaces:[-][/c][/b]\nA ship is comprised of many moving parts, and many of those parts are in contact with high energy ejections, such as weapons and thrusters. These provide a constant drain on the energy a shield generator needs to use to operate.\nIn order to prevent the shields from draining from the plasma of thrusters or the force being imparted on the barrels of weapons, energy buffers are included in such devices that consume power from the shield generators without impacting their performance.\n[b][c][dd0000]Thrusters (CV):[-][/c][/b] Reduce shield capacity by 5 for each thruster\n[b][c][dd0000]Weapons (CV/BA):[-][/c][/b] Reduce shield capacity by 25 for each conventional weapon and 50 for each energy weapon\n[b][c][dd0000]Weapons (HV/SV):[-][/c][/b] Reduce shield capacity by 10 for each conventional weapon and 15 for each energy weapon\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Obtaining Advanced Shields:[-][/c][/b]\nShield Generators are upgraded from the lower grade to the higher grades using a Multitool set to the Upgrade Mode.

Unlike similar large spiders of earth, the arrangement of eyes, chelicerae and lack of hair makes actual classification difficult due to it's ability to consume and digest food internally, which is completely different from any known earth spider.\n\nPossessing brown or tan camouflage coloration on the legs, abdomen and thorax; and hinged chelcerae with secondary jaws, the Erebus Spider survives as an ambush predator. Hiding amongst trees, bushes and tall grass until potential pret approaches before launching in a headlong sprint at its target.\nMidly-venomous, the Erebus Spider relies on its chelicerae to pincer the limbs of its prey and break bones with its impressive biteforce, thus preventing escape and allowing the spider to take its time dismembering its prey.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: The Erebus Spider is an invasive species of arachnid commonly found on many planets in the local system. The presence of these spiders on so many planets indicates that they were intentionally or accidentally introduced from another planet.\nWhile destructive to native flora and fauna, they survive mostly on a diet of Leafcutter Insects, but are not averse to attacking anything that strays close to their nests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead choosing to strike fast and retreat while its poison takes effect and begins to slow the target enough for it to go in for the kill with little risk for itself.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: The Charon Spider is fairly solitary and do not roam far from their nest; usually under large rocks and in canyons in arid regions near streams or springs where prey are most common.\nAlthough found on many planets, they are not destructive to the environment and are known to keep many of the more dangerous predator's numbers in check.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much like the namesake, the Pluton Spider is found underground in caves and abandoned buildings where it's cool, damp and dark.\nPluton Spider are known to take down predator and prey several times their size due to their ability to spit venom to stun and incapacitate the target without ever getting into reach.\nSpecially developed eyes and exoskeleton allow it to see infrared and adjust the patterning across its back to improve concealment. While it does possess minor camouflaging abilities that let it adjust the patterns on it's body, it cannot change the coloration.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Pluton Spiders rarely stray into daylight and so an accurate count of their locations and population density is unknown. They are found in many planets and have a preference for the damp, dark confines of abandoned buildings and the biomechanically-grown arterial tunnels left in the wake of a Legacy infestation over the caves they evolved to survive in. It's believed that this preference is due to the radioactive nature of any Promethium-powered reactor and the self-sustaining energy systems inherent in Legacy technology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has a leaf-green exoskeleton with a marbled brown to red carapace running from the optical turret at the top of its head to its tail.\nDespite the name, the Leafcutter Insect is more closely related to Crustaceans rather than other hexapods. Omnivorous, it bears compact internal organs beneath its hard carapace and a protruding optical turret that gives it a 270 degree field of view of its surroundings.\n\nDespite lacking the ability to bite any interloper in their territory due to their unusually arranged mouth, their specially-evolved forelegs possess an extremely powerful kick capable of denting steel. Coupled with sharped, edged barbs on the backs of the forelegs typically used for cutting plant stems and dragging food into their mouth, they allow the Leafcutter Insect to pierce and hang onto their would-be predator.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Leafcutter Insects are commonly found all across the Andromeda Galaxy, usually in temperate grassy plains and forests where much of their food is found. They do not tolerate heat very well, so are never found in arid or desertous climates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite it's fearsome appearance, the Thymosaurus is largely passive; Eating mostly carrion and some large insects. It prefers to roam solitarily across temperate planet's equatorial band in search of potential mates.\n\nThe Thymosaurus' intimidating appearance belies it's fragile physiology as it suffers from poor eyesight due to the size and position of its eyes on its broad head coupled with inadequate reach and strength in its forelimbs. These weaknesses are made up for with the incredible strength of its hind limbs and tail, on the end of which it possesses a heavily armored thagomizer which it can swing with a force upwards of 1000 Newtons.\n\nWhile not naturally aggressive, the Thymosaurus has an exceedingly thick hide and bones, making it very durable to both impacts and penetration; necessary when fighting off rivals for a mate that are similarly equipped with a spiked, hammer-like tail for which it's named.\nAs such, it's best to avoid angering one if at all possible as they are known to pursue an aggressor back to their home and exact retribution.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Thymosaurus are typically found on temperate planets, between grassy meadows and the savannah where their chosen food source (Erebus Spiders and Leafcutter Insects) are most abundant.\nAlthough they are known to eat Telluropods, they will generally avoid large bodies of water due to their propensity for overbalancing. Drinking from a lake or pond for a Thymosaurus is typically done from a prone position, which leaves it open for attack.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Having too few legs and a tail that developed for a different set of functions than the typical scorpions of Earth.\nThe ""stinger"" of the Nyxiss scorpion functions as both a weapon and as reproductive organ for the creature. Used to deposit eggs into the wound made by the stinger, and poison in order to slowly kill the target; ensuring a rich environment in which the new hatchlings can grow.\n\nOriginating from a barren, red, volcanic environment the Nyxiss Scorpion evolved to blend in with the reds and browns of it's home world. It has extreme resistance to high temperatures and can survive in temperatures exceeding 700 degrees celcius. This resistance to heat has aided them in becoming widespread across the galaxy by climbing into the vents and thruster exhausts of landed cargo ships and escaping to more temperate planets; provided they can survive in vacuum long enough.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Nyxiss Scorpions can be found on a wide variety of planets; usually in warm, dark or radioactive environments underground. They are very rarely seen on the surface and prefer to hide in vents in abandoned structures or the organic arterial tunnels left in the wake of a Legacy infestation.\nOn their home planets, volcanic activity and high temperatures force them to remain on the surface and avoid underground burrows making their appearance on magmatic worlds far more common; and their appearance much harder to discern among the red rocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With a chitinous exoskeleton that protects its internal organs and powerful legs, the Wraithworm Queen outclasses any other known insect in both size and mass.\nBy expanding the chitin plates on it's abdomen it is able to inflate it's stomach and align it's esophagus linearly and by contracting the muscles rapidly can expel toxic and corrosive gastric juices as a projectile up to 30 meters as a defensive mechanism.\n\nMale Wraithworms are far smaller than their female counterparts, being mostly blind and short limbed; they spend almost all of their lives burrowed deep underground. Males attract female Wraithworms by creating a spacious burrow for the queen, with walls hardened with saliva excreted to support larger rooms.\nFemales will choose males that provide the largest burrow, determining that they possess the strength, skills and hardening to produce better offspring.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Although not as numerous as the male counterpart; the Wraithworm Queen is the most commonly encountered due to its size. They do not burrow as the male does, so spend most of their unmated time above ground until approached by a prospective mate.\nThis is problematic on inhabited planets, as males will often burrow into artificial structures and claim them as a nest to attract females.

Having developed a means of eating while underground, it is incapable of eating it's food while above ground. Seemingly oblivious to anything on the surface unless defending itself.\nLike female wraithworms the Sandsiphon can spit a ball of digestive fluids at an attacker or when startled that is both toxic and corrosive to most metals.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Sandsiphons are quite common on arid and desertous planets. However, due to their nature of burrowing through the sand, they are rarely seen on the surface. Furthermore, the vibrations set off by nearby hover engines cause them to panic and burrow beneath the sand, making ground observations by biologists difficult.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It seems to share a common evolutionary path to those of the Dromaeosaurid Genus of the Cretaceous period, but with a tendency towards a more reptillian form over the feathered contemporaries of our own galaxy.\nThis development is thought to be due to their environment being primarily tropical where the development of feathers would hinder the creature while stalking prey in the wet jungle and cause numerous health problems.\n\nAndroraptors travel and hunt in family packs, with the younger raptors being educated during the daytime by following behind the parents and imitating their actions to take down prey with supervision. During the night however, the parents hunt freely making night time especially hazardous for prey and human alike as these fully-grown raptors are larger, faster and more vicious at night while unrestrained with taking care of youngsters.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Androraptors are widespread across the Andromeda galaxy and common on most breathable Temperate planets. How or why they were spread across the galaxy is still unknown, but due to the slight genetic variations it's believed they were seeded there at least several hundred thousand years ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only building nests to house their eggs and early stages of development of their children until they're old enough to begin moving on their own.\n\nOviraptors are omnivorous, eating berries, fruit, mushrooms and nuts when available; hunting vertebrates such as Erebus spiders and Leafcutters when easy prey is encountered. But otherwise are completely passive to anything that does not immediately pose a threat to them or their young. Preferring to flee, rather than attack when approached unless something harms their offspring.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Oviraptors prefer cold climates and are often found in or near snow in family groups of two adults and as many as five young. They are not harmful to the environment and do not engage in territorial disputes with other life forms.\nAlthough parents will attack anything that harms their offspring; the children themselves are curious and playful and will often follow and get into mischief in human camps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Branching off from the main Andromedan genus several hundred thousand years ago, likely due to adverse environmental factors. The result of this evolutionary change includes developed legs designed for prolonged travel at speed and a vertically-aligned mouth developed for eating the bark of the larger and hardier trees; rather than leaves or grass. This trait is also shared by the Leafcutter insect, suggesting a common factor.\n\nMoularidons form family packs or herds of females and offspring much like Elephants. Males, or bulls roam either alone or with other males until breeding season. Although there is often threat displays and sparring among the males when contesting a mate, there are rarely any serious fights that cause injury.\n\nBecause of their intelligence, size, strength and stamina, the Tal'ohn utilize Moularidons for transport and heavy lifting. Taking a great deal of care of their Moularidon population and protecting wild herds from Zirax poachers, even at risk to themselves.\nMoularidon are also farmed for milk by the Tal'ohn as one of their main exports, commanding a high price on the commodities market.

They will typically spend their days in open meadows near a water source and venture into the forest to feed on the bark of the older trees.\nThey avoid the rainforest and jungles at night due to the increased Androraptor presence as this is the time when the Adults hunt, and are known to target Moularidons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Be prepared and get your turrets up quick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_CW0OCiG,"[b][c][00ffee][u]Base Attacks:[/u][-][/c][/b]\nYou've placed your first Base, which means you're ready to establish advanced production methods required for improved thrusters, weapons and ammunition for higher quality ships. However, the Zirax are aware that you have built a base and likely on a planet in their domain.\nThey will be sending troop transports, Drones and Bombers to take out your base, so the first thing you need to get in place to protect your investments are [b][c][ff5c5c]TURRETS[-][/c][/b]. Without Turrets, you have no hope of defending your base from even the most minor of attacks.\n\n[b][u][c][00ffee]Point Defense:[-][/c][/u][/b]\nThe first thing you'll need on your base is a Generator, Fuel Tank, Ammunition Container or Controller, a Small Constructor (for Base) or better. With your constructor powered and supplied, you can now produce your first turrets with basic materials (Iron, Copper, Silicon) that will keep your base defended.\n\n[b][c][ffae00]Projectile Turrets (Base)[-][/c][/b]\n[b][c][ffffff]Minigun Turret:[-][/c][/b] The Minigun Turret is the best weapon for base defense. While it has slightly shorter range than the Cannon Turret, it has a higher rotation speed, better tracking and a higher damage modifier against drones and troop transports. It suffers a damage penalty against blocks though, making it less effective when used offensively against ships and POIs.\n[b][c][ffffff]Cannon Turret:[-][/c][/b] The Cannon Turret is best used against ships and blocks. It's more accurate than the minigun turret, but turns slower while tracking a fast object (E.g. Bombers). It suffers from a minor damage penalty against drones and other entities, while receiving a damage bonus against armor blocks.\n\nBy taking manual control of either turret, you gain extra combat effectiveness.\n[b][c][ffffff]Minigun Turret:[-][/c][/b] By holding LMB + RMB you can remove the safety limiter on the turret and fire it manually far faster than the turret can fire on it's own. You will lose accuracy at long range though.\n[b][c][ffffff]Cannon Turret:[-][/c][/b] The Cannon turret will also fire slightly faster while operated manually. RMB lets you change the ammunition settings to fire incendiary rounds that explode when they hit an enemy.\n\n[b][u][c][ff0000]Enemy Units:[-][/c][/u][/b]\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Minigun Siege Drones:[-][/c][/b] These relatively slow-moving drones are well armored and equipped with specialized ammunition designed to impart thermal damage to shields; causing more damage than regular UCH ammunition to shields.\nUltimately, these drones are designed for focused attacks and search and destroy missions.\n\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Rocket Siege Drones:[-][/c][/b] High-speed drones equipped with a pair of rocket racks. They circle your base before launching a bombardment of low-impact rockets over a wide area. In order to function at this speed, they are only lightly armored and can be destroyed by a Minigun Turret or two easily.\n\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Light Bomber:[-][/c][/b] The most dangerous unit deployed in early base attacks is the Light Bomber. More durable than the Rocket Siege Drones and with considerably better accuracy; the Light Bomber drops a single high-explosive bomb at key targets on your base.\n\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Troop Transport: [-][/c][/b]The light troop transport is durable, but slow aircraft. It can carry up to 8 troops and is unarmed, but will usually not exceed a squad of 6. Your typical full base attack will consist of at least one Troop transport supported by siege drones acting as both protection and decoys while the transport lands.\n\n[b][u][c][ff0000]Invasion Force:[-][/c][/u][/b]\nInvasion level base attacks only occur on higher difficulty planet and ONLY if your base is placed within zirax-claimed territory. You will have a high chance of getting a different set of enemies that are going to [i]really[/i] want to take your base.\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Heavy Siege Drone (Minigun)[-][/c][/b]: Twice the firepower, Twice the size, Triple the health.\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Heavy Siege Drone (Rocket)[-][/c][/b]: Same firepower, twice the size, twice the health.\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Heavy Bomber[-][/c][/b]: A more durable, angrier version of the Light Bomber.\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Troop Dropship[-][/c][/b]: Better armored, these dropships can carry up to 16 troops.\nA high-end invasion force will not be a couple of drones and a transport; you'll be facing a dozen drones and multiple dropships hell-bent on taking your base or turning it into a smoldering crater.\n\n[b][u][c][00ffee]Tal'ohn Base Attacks:[-][/c][/u][/b]\nIf you're unlucky enough to anger the Tal'ohn, they too will attack your base. Not with drones or transports, but with overwhelming numbers of hunters and animals. It may seem comical, but many people have lost their bases against the Tal'ohn because they failed to eliminate the Shaman.\n\nIn the event of a Tal'ohn Base Attack, your goal should be the immediate removal of the Tal'ohn Shaman. You can see their location from the glowing pillar of light they produce. As long as one Shaman remains, more enemies will continue to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An abomination is the resulting Third Stage of genetic reconditioning by the virus as it has broken down the host's body down to the most vital elements and over time will slowly reconstruct the host by incorporating materials both organic and synthetic to create a new lifeform with the Fourth Stage.\nDue to a lack of stimulus and direction from the Gestalt that makes up the Legacy, Abomination very rarely evolve into a fourth-stage entity; eventually falling into stasis at a stalled state of development.\n\nAbomination are physically strong and moderately fast, possessing adaptive thermo-regulation that allows them to survive in the most hostile of environments, including the vaccuum of space. They possess no ranged weapons and due to the presently dormant state of the Legacy Virus, are usually not contagious. They still carry a host of bacterial and viral afflictions for which they are asymptomatic, but still carriers.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Abominations can be found in legacy-infested buildings left abandoned following an infection; usually born from a Legacy Node left submerged beneath the ground from the War of Silence that has activated upon receiving stimulus from intelligent activity or mining operations; awakening it temporarily before it returns to a dormant state, The damage already done.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While their higher cognitive and fabrication abilities appear to have been lost in the resolution of that long-ago war, they are still a force to be reckoned with. Their internal bioreactors are still functional, but at present only produce waste materials in the form of Pentaxid and other exotic elemental products.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Overseers are comparatively rare among the Legacy's creature; but can be found on barren and metallic planets in quite large numbers. The reason for this is still unknown, since the Legacy did very little material extraction and there is very little or no life on those planets to infect.\n\nBecause of the distinction between the Overseers in the past, when the Legacy was fully awake and the remnants left in the wake of the war; the original Overseer is now designed an ""Overlord"".

pda_O0JW0am,"[b][c][00ffee][u]Secondary Firing Modes:[/u][-][/c][/b]\nSome weapons possess a secondary firing mode designed to be used as an alternative or in conjunction with their standard firing method. These are available for both handheld weapons as well as fixed and turret weapons.\nSecondary Firing Modes are available either through a [c][ffffff]Radial Menu[-][/c] or by using your [b][c][ffffff]Right-Mouse Button[-][/c][/b] (RMB). These do not consume different ammunition, but in the case of some unique weapons will have a lengthy delay (e.g. Elite Assault Rifle).\n\n[b][c][00ffee][u]Handheld Weapons:[/u][-][/c][/b]\nFew handheld weapons have a secondary firing mode; restricted mainly to the Heavy Weapons such as the Miniguns and Plasma Cannons.\n\n[b][c][ff0000]Miniguns:[-][/c][/b] By holding LMB and RMB together you can disengage the safeties on the weapon designed to keep the weapon controllable.\nThis doubles the RPM of the minigun's barrels; Increasing the rate of fire, damage and ammo consumption. You will suffer a significant increase in recoil and a reduction in accuracy however, so it's best used against in close quarters against multiple enemies or drones.\n\n[b][c][ff0000]Plasma Cannons:[-][/c][/b] The RMB will open a Radial Menu that allows you to adjust the output of the Plasma Cannon turning a ball of plasma into a Particle Beam.\nParticle Beams move at extremely high speeds and will pierce a hole straight through enemy units and small vessels. They do not explode like normal plasma shots, instead dealing massive damage to a single target; allowing them to destroy any Sentry Guns, Drones or Heavy Mechs.\n\n[b][c][ff0000]Elite Assault Rifle:[-][/c][/b] The Elite Assault Rifle is a customized variant of the Advanced Assault Rifle. Including improvements to the barrel and firing system for a slight improvement to the weapon's damage over the Advanced Assault Rifle; the Elite Assault Rifle sacrifices the use of a scope for an Underslung Grenade Launcher.\nBy pressing RMB, the weapon will fire an anti-personnel Frag Grenade in a ballistic arc up to 20 meters. Effective for clearing away hordes of Abominations and Infesters.\n\n[b][u][c][00ffee]Scanning Equipment:[-][/c][/u][/b]\nDetectors allow you to find both ore deposits beneath the ground and enemies in your vicinity. With the secondary firing mode of the detector, you can keep enemies tagged on your HUD for 5 minutes so you can concentrate on the enemy instead of worrying about re-pinging your radar to find them.\n\n[b][c][2eafff]Detector (HV, SV, CV):[-][/c][/b] The standard Detector has two modes of Detection. The First fires a sonar-like pulse that detects all thermal, radiological and metallic activity up to it's maximum range and displays the results to the Pilot's HUD for 60 seconds.\nThe Second mode (RMB) fires a short-ranged pulse that will identify and tag all targets for 300 seconds. Allowing you to keep faster targets displayed on your HUD in combat without needing to change weapons in the heat of battle to reacquire the target after it has left your field of view.\n[b][c][2eafff][-][/c][/b]\n[b][c][2eafff]Long-Range Radar (SV, CV):[-][/c][/b] A high-powered upgrade of the standard detectors that will identify thermal and energy signatures at extremely long distances for a 5 second duration using LMB.\nUsing RMB will fire a secondary pulse that functions at the same distance as the standard detector but keep all identified targets displayed for 120 seconds, as opposed to the 60 seconds.\n\n[b][u][c][00ffee]Fixed Weapons:[-][/c][/u][/b]\n[b][c][ff0000]Multiple Rocket Launcher (CV):[-][/c][/b] Rather than an alternative firing mode; the Heavy Rocket Launcher for Capital Vessels engages safeties to allow the use of the primary weapon inside a planet's atmosphere at a reduced range and rate of fire.\nUnder normal circumstances, the firing of a space-designed weapon in atmosphere causes the weapon to detonate as it encounters the resistance and pressure of an atmosphere.\n\n[b][c][00ffee][u]Turrets:[/u][-][/c][/b]\nUnlike the fixed weapons, Turret's secondary modes are available ONLY while being manned by a person. They do not retain any mode settings, and therefore require that the pilot relinquish control of the ship or that the ship has additional players on board to manually operate the weapons.\n\n[b][c][ffae00]Cannon Turrets:[-][/c][/b]\nWith the Radial Menu (RMB) while manned, you can switch the Armor-Piercing Ammunition for Incendiary Rounds. These explosive rounds fire slower, but deal higher damage to drones and entities and set them on fire in the process.\n\n[b][c][ffae00]Artillery Turrets (CV, BA):[-][/c][/b]\nThe most unique of any Turret's firing mode, The Artillery Turret while manually operated can launch a 375mm EMP Shell instead of a standard artillery shell.\nThese unique weapons are shorter ranged, follow a ballistic trajectory, are comparatively slow-moving and deal no damage to any structure. However, on impact with a ship's shield the damage it deals to the shield is catastrophic. Either disabling the shield entirely or reducing the shield's strength by half.\nHeavy Artillery Turrets can fire EMP shells at twice the speed of the Standard Artillery Turrets.\nHV Heavy Artillery Turret can fire EMP shells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some weapons are better at some things than others, even though it may not seem like it. Others can be either too heavy or have too much recoil to be fired over a long duration, requiring restraint.

Penetrating through-and-through, with less internal damage.\n\n[b][c][ffff00]Laser Weapons[-][/c][/b] are a recent addition to the UCH's line-up of weapons, with their effectiveness shared by [b][c][ffff00]Plasma weaponry[-][/c][/b].\nLaser weapons superheat their target, dealing massive thermal damage in an instant. Painful and damaging to a humanoid target, this has proven more effective and portable in dealing with mechanical enemies and light drones, melting their armor and components with a higher efficiency than expected.\nUnfortunately, the recent addition of a reflective coating on heavier drones and interceptors has reduced that effectiveness against those targets.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]Shotguns[-][/c][/b] lack range and accuracy, but in the close confines of corridors and rooms these weapons make a serious mess of the lightly armored and soft targets that don't have much or any protection against a face full of buckshot.\nHowever, for those such as Heavy Mechanoids that [i]do[/i] have protection against buckshot, the shotgun barely makes a dent.\n\nAlthough not common on your average battlefield, [b][c][ffbb00]Miniguns[-][/c][/b] have proven to be more effective than previously thought once they were made small and light enough to be wielded by a soldier. Possessing an all-round effectiveness against armored targets, the Minigun is a sight to behold.\nUnfortunately, it's still heavy and possesses immense recoil, steadily draining the stamina of its wielder until it's too heavy to be fired.\n\n[b][c][ffff00]Flamethrowers[-][/c][/b], like miniguns are heavy weapons not suited for sustained firing. They do make up for it with a spectacular jet of burning fuel that will cook any form of wildlife, especially those nasty overseers and big bugs.\nUnfortunately, it's less effective against an armored humanoid and ineffective against any sort of mechanoid.\n\nFinally, we have rockets and missiles. Fast, destructive projectile weapons that will devastate whatever they hit. Most effective against drones, mechanoids and other heavily armored targets.

pda_4OKquGe,"[c][00ffee][u][b]Trading Basics:[/b][/u][-][/c]\nIf you're out and about in the galaxy, you may encounter a factory, mining site or trader in need or offering paid work. In most cases, they'll want you to find them a specific item(s) that they will pay a minimum of double the item's original market price.\nSome high-value items include industrial, commercial or medical commodities that aren't able to be crafted in a Constructor. Items such as Superconductors, Heat Exchangers, Narcotics, Scientific Equipment, Filters, Mining Equipment and any number of odd minerals and plants.\n\n[c][ffbb00][u][b]Industrial Factories:[/b][/u][-][/c]\nIndustrial commodities are typically requested by factories and a few mining operations working on deep-earth deposits. These can be obtained in small amounts from some traders on Trade Stations at exorbitant prices. For a much better deal and in larger quantities, you'll need to find and check into a factory of the right type.\nFactories don't typically deal with end consumers, so you'll probably need to prove your value by doing a job for them; Though in many cases, these factories break down or run out of materials and may just want supplies. At the very least, even after providing assistance, they'll have a ready supply of jobs for you to undertake for a good pay-out.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]Arriake Technology[-][/c][/b] is an [b][c][ff5c5c]Electronics Factory[-][/c][/b] that deals in Superconductors, Communication Equipment and Optronics. They are a main supplier of QuantumStar.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]Solaris-AMP[-][/c][/b] is an [b][c][ff5c5c]Electronics Factory[-][/c][/b] that deals in energy generation, and so produce Superconductors, Reactor Cores and Solar Cells.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]P3[-][/c][/b] is an Industrial Factory that produces low-cost industrial equipment such as Mining Equipment, Spare Parts and Prefab Housing.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]Zero Horizons Manufacturing[-][/c][/b] is an Industrial Factory that operates in space, using Zero-G manufacturing to produce high quality Thruster Components, Heat Exchangers and Optronics.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]Non-Linear Productions[-][/c][/b] is an Industrial Factory that specializes in Radioactive protection; producing Reactor Cores, Radiation Shielding, Mining Equipment and even Advanced Warp Drives.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]Chromium-Sierra Sciences[-][/c][/b] is a Scientific Producer of medical equipment such as Air Filters, Scientific Equipment, Tablets and Chemicals.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]Thermal Interactions Ltd[-][/c][/b] is another Industrial Factory that deals primarily in heat distribution and radiation equipment. As such their main products consist of Heat Exchangers, Coolant and Radiation Shielding.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]Hostile Apparatus[-][/c][/b] is a Robotics Factory. Their main products include portable security mechanoids and androids, but also extend to Spare Parts, Robotics and Data Tablets.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]Vitalife Pharmaceuticals[-][/c][/b] is a Medical Producer that supplies both medical components, Filters and restricted narcotics to a variety of stores across the galaxy from Andromedical to Ok'y Medical.\n\nAlthough not technically a factory, there are a number of [c][66ccff][b]Gas Harvesters[/b][-][/c] in space that trawl the upper atmosphere of gas giants for rare gases, and serve as an ideal source of Hydrogen, Helium, Nitrogen and Xenon.\n\n[b][c][66ccff]Chemical Refineries[-][/c][/b] also serve as a source of Chemicals, Helium and Filters.\n\n[c][ff00ff][u][b]Other Industrial Locations:[/b][/u][-][/c]\nOutside of the normal commodity-based factories are [b][c][ffbb00]Waste Treatment Plants[-][/c][/b] that will buy your Toxic Waste and other waste products and break them down into Fertilizer, Nitrogen and any number of useful inert products.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]InterWeapon[-][/c][/b] have any number of munitions factories that produce high-end ammunition at low cost and will even exchange Sulfur for Nitrocellulose at a 1:20 rate.\nSulfur can be mined from magmatic rock on any volcanic (lava) planet.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]Totally Overpowered Brewery[-][/c][/b] supplies high-quality liquors and beer at low prices. [b][c][00bb00]Tal'on[-][/c][/b] also operate [b][c][00bb00]breweries[-][/c][/b] with superior prices and quality, but their production amounts are quite low.\n\n[b][c][00bb00]Tal'on[-][/c][/b] also operate [b][c][00bb00]Tanneries[-][/c][/b] and [b][c][00bb00]Quarries[-][/c][/b] that are a good source of Leather and Diamonds respectively, among a number of other products.\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nThere are yet even more factories and facilities out there that deal with even more exotic and strange items and commodities. Just as there are equally strange requests from [c][00ffff][b]Traders [/b][-][/c]on trade stations and [b][c][00ffff]Mining Operations[-][/c][/b] where a steady supply of resources brings in the big credits.\n\n[b][c][ff0000]Hacked Data[-][/c][/b] is a commonly requested item among station traders.

Some may have you collect an item or visit a specific planet type and you may have to warp to other star systems to complete it. Some missions use a combination of some or all of the PDA, tokens, and dialog.[-][/c]\n[c][ffffff]Most mission objectives can be obtained in multiple places in case you lose the item or otherwise can no longer complete the mission from a particular POI. Those that use unique POIs can either be repeated in the POI or can have the objectives manually marked as complete.[-][/c]\n\n\n[c][00ffff]I completed a mission and nothing happened. What now?[-][/c]\n[c][ffffff]Many of the custom missions and story is still a work in progress. Alpha 12 completely changed how missions and storytelling can be done so it required a rewrite of the PDA. If you find any unique items, hold on to them because they might have a purpose. More is planned to be added later on.[-][/c]\n\n\n[c][00ffff]I lost an important mission item. What do I do?[-][/c]\n[c][ffffff]Most of the important mission items can be obtained again, either from the same source you first found it at, or from another version of the POI somewhere else in the galaxy.

A planet is its own playfield, as is a moon and a space orbit. Going from planet to orbit means you enter a new playfield.\n[c][00ff00]Sector[-][/c]: Any location on the solar system map that you can warp to. A sector encompasses a planet, its orbit, and any of its moons. A standalone asteroid field can also be a sector.\n\n[c][00ff00]Solar System[-][/c]: An object on the galaxy map containing a star with various planets and sector POIs.

eden_pda_eeS8e,"Your priorities and needs can vary depending on your choice of starting planet and game difficulty options. This is just general guidance.\n\nFirst, make sure your immediate surroundings are safe then read over any [c][00ff00]starting mission text[-][/c] (if there is any) and the information in the [c][00ff00]planet description[-][/c]. You can usually get a good idea of what you need to do based on those two things.\n\nNext you will need to find some Iron Ore if you didn't start with a [c][00ff00]Portable Constructor[-][/c]. On some planets this can be a challenge and you will have to travel far before you find your first iron. Once you've built a [c][00ff00]Portable Constructor[-][/c] you can use it to convert [c][00ff00]Crushed Stone[-][/c] into basic ores.\nFood can be obtained from wild [c][00ff00]plants [-][/c]and [c][00ff00]animals[-][/c], or from your starting missions.\nIf you are on a planet without oxygen, you will also need to set up a [c][00ff00]O2 Condenser[-][/c] to obtain oxygen.\n\nSome planets can have [c][ff0000]dangerous wildlife[-][/c], [c][ff0000]soldiers[-][/c], or [c][ff0000]drones [-][/c]hunting you, or[c][ff0000] extreme environments[-][/c] with radiation, temperature, or weather hazards. Check the planet description for any warnings.\nYou will need to think of creative solutions to dealing with the obstacles that you face. Some general hints:\n\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]Some wildlife will run away when damaged. Use this to keep them away from you.\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]Pay attention to tooltips on wild plants. Some can cure ailments, but may cause food poisoning in the process.\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]Headshots deal more damage, especially against humanoids.\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]If you have a jetpack, hiding on top of a rock can give you temporary safety from predators.\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]Drones can be intimidating enemies, but shooting them can disorient them and aiming for the red dot deals bonus damage. Pistols, assault rifles, and especially sniper rifles are more effective against drones than your shotgun or survival tool.\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]You can use the player drone to mine, scout, or retrieve a lost backpack.\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]The Survival Tool can harvest surface rocks, mine, damage enemies, and salvage blocks or devices, but it does these things poorly.\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]Promethium can sometimes be difficult to find but you can substitute bio fuel to power your ships.\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]Solar power is not effective on all starting planets.\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]Using the Fresh Start option will spawn you back on your original starting planet, but will not remove any of your reputation, levels, structures, or bank account balance. This can be used as a last resort if you die and cannot respawn in a safe location.\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]Consider setting up some early game blueprints in creative mode tailored to your starting planet. Note that some starting planets forbid use of the blueprint factory.\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]You will usually only find basic resources on your starting planet, enough to build a Small Vessel.

eden_pda_4K8FI,"There are some locations that are occupied by dangerous enemies or that have extreme environmental hazards.\nApproaching these locations without being prepared can mean a quick death for yourself and loss of your ship.\n\nAlways look at the description of a sector, planet, or moon before entering it. You can view descriptions on the solar system map using the various checkboxes.\n\nThis is by no means a complete list of dangers, but these are the most common things to look out for:\n-[c][ffff00]High gravity[-][/c]. A good rule of thumb is you need 10m/s down thrust for each 1G of gravity on a planet with no atmosphere. Check your ship's thrust values in the statistics page of the control panel while in orbit and compare it to the planet's listed gravity. Atmospheric density can help provide extra lift to counteract gravity while your ship is in motion.\n-[c][ffff00]Temperature and radiation[-][/c]. Some locations can have extreme temperatures or radiation. This can be offset with armor or armor boosters, consumables, medication, or by staying inside your ship as much as possible.\n-[c][ffff00]Dangerous enemies[-][/c]. Some planets can have unique enemies that pose a serious risk to you or your ship. Check the planet description for any hints and approach unfamiliar enemies with caution.\n-[c][ffff00]Low visibility[-][/c]. Some planets can have low or no visibility, even when using night vision.\n\nA planet or sector usually lists an estimated difficulty level in the description, based on how hard a location is due to factors such as enemies, hazards, or other challenges present.\n[i]This is different from the difficulty level listed on the right hand side of the screen and is a more accurate estimate of how hard a location will actually be.[/i]\n[i][/i]-[c][00ffff]Beginner[-][/c]. This location is extremely easy. While it can still have hostile POIs, it's often lacking in dangerous wildlife or patrolling drones.\n-[c][00ff00]Easy[-][/c]. This location is fairly easy, with low enemy density or difficulty and few environmental hazards.\n-[c][ffff00]Medium[-][/c]. This location can have standard enemies and POIs that pose a challenge and some environmental hazards that can be dealt with using basic equipment. Shields recommended.\n-[c][ff0000]Hard[-][/c]. This location can have enemies or environmental hazards that pose a significant challenge even to experienced players. Advanced equipment and T2 shields strongly recommended.\n-[c][ff00ff]Ultra[-][/c]. This location is extremely difficult and often has unique challenges to overcome even for advanced players.
